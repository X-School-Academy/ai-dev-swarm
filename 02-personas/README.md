# Stage 02 - Personas

## Stage Goal

This stage creates detailed user personas that bring the target users identified in Stage 00 to life. Personas transform abstract user segments into concrete, relatable characters that guide design and development decisions throughout the project.

User personas are critical because they keep the team focused on real user needs rather than assumptions. For the Dev Swarm WebUI, we have two distinct user groups with different motivations: non-technical stakeholders who need accessibility, and technical users who want efficiency. Clear personas ensure we design for both without sacrificing one for the other.

## Stage Files

**User Personas**

- `personas.md` - 3 detailed personas: Sarah (PM), Marcus (BA), Alex (Dev)

**User Stories**

- `user-stories.md` - User stories grouped by feature area with MVP priority

**Pain Points**

- `pain-points.md` - Pain points mapped to each persona with severity ratings

## Key Insights

**Personas:**
- Sarah Chen (PM) - Primary focus, needs visual interface without CLI
- Marcus Rivera (BA) - Secondary focus, even less technical than Sarah
- Alex Kim (Dev) - Tertiary focus, wants visual overview + CLI option

**MVP Priority:**
- P0: Stage overview, document viewing/editing, one-click execution, real-time output, stop execution
- P1: Skip/unskip stages, approve proposals, manual sync
- P2: Sprint automation, run all sprints

**Critical Pain Points to Solve:**
- CLI barrier to entry (blocks non-technical users entirely)
- No visual feedback on project state
- No control over AI execution

## Next Stage

Stage 03 (MVP) - Define MVP scope based on persona priorities and user stories
