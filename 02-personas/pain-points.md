# Pain Points

## Sarah Chen (Product Manager)

### Pain Point 1: CLI Barrier to Entry
**Problem:** Can't use dev-swarm without terminal knowledge
**Impact:** Excluded from AI-assisted development workflows entirely
**Current Workaround:** Asks developers to run commands; waits for their availability
**Cost:** Delays in ideation, dependency on others, feeling of helplessness

### Pain Point 2: No Visual Feedback
**Problem:** Can't see project state or progress at a glance
**Impact:** Doesn't know where the project stands; can't plan effectively
**Current Workaround:** Asks developers for status updates or navigates folder structures
**Cost:** Wasted time, communication overhead, outdated information

### Pain Point 3: Can't Review AI Output Easily
**Problem:** AI-generated content is in markdown files scattered across folders
**Impact:** Reviewing requires opening multiple files in different applications
**Current Workaround:** Uses VS Code or a markdown viewer separately
**Cost:** Context switching, harder to provide feedback, slower review cycles

### Pain Point 4: No Control Over AI Execution
**Problem:** Once a command runs, can't stop or modify it
**Impact:** Must wait for completion even when output is clearly wrong
**Current Workaround:** Asks developer to cancel; sometimes just waits it out
**Cost:** Wasted compute time, frustration, loss of confidence in the tool

## Marcus Rivera (Business Analyst)

### Pain Point 1: Technical Tool Intimidation
**Problem:** AI development tools assume programming knowledge
**Impact:** Feels the tools aren't meant for him; doesn't attempt to use them
**Current Workaround:** Stays in familiar tools (Word, Excel); misses AI benefits
**Cost:** Slower documentation, no AI assistance, competitive disadvantage

### Pain Point 2: Translation Gap
**Problem:** Business requirements don't automatically become technical specs
**Impact:** Developers misinterpret requirements; rework needed
**Current Workaround:** Multiple meetings to clarify; detailed written specs
**Cost:** Communication overhead, delays, frustration on both sides

### Pain Point 3: No Visibility Into Implementation
**Problem:** Can't see how requirements translate to development stages
**Impact:** Disconnected from the development process he initiated
**Current Workaround:** Periodic check-ins; relies on developers for updates
**Cost:** Lack of ownership, delayed feedback, potential misalignment

### Pain Point 4: Cryptic Error Messages
**Problem:** When something fails, messages are technical and unhelpful
**Impact:** Can't self-recover; must escalate to technical team
**Current Workaround:** Screenshots error; asks developer what it means
**Cost:** Blocked progress, dependency on others, loss of confidence

## Alex Kim (Full-Stack Developer)

### Pain Point 1: Mental State Tracking
**Problem:** Must remember which stages are done across multiple projects
**Impact:** Risk of skipping stages or redoing completed work
**Current Workaround:** Checks folder contents manually; keeps mental notes
**Cost:** Cognitive load, occasional mistakes, slower context switching

### Pain Point 2: No Easy Interruption
**Problem:** Can't cleanly stop a misbehaving AI agent mid-execution
**Impact:** Must wait for completion or forcefully kill the process
**Current Workaround:** Ctrl+C in terminal; sometimes loses partial progress
**Cost:** Wasted time, potential data loss, frustration

### Pain Point 3: Tool Switching Overhead
**Problem:** Constantly switching between terminal, file browser, and editor
**Impact:** Slower workflow, lost context, friction in development
**Current Workaround:** Multiple windows/tabs open simultaneously
**Cost:** Desktop clutter, cognitive overhead, slower task completion

### Pain Point 4: Inconsistent AI Behavior
**Problem:** Same inputs produce different outputs across runs
**Impact:** Can't rely on deterministic results; must verify everything
**Current Workaround:** Re-run commands until output is acceptable; manual fixes
**Cost:** Wasted time, reduced trust in AI, extra validation effort

## Pain Point Summary by Severity

**Critical (Blocks Usage):**
- CLI barrier (Sarah, Marcus)
- Technical tool intimidation (Marcus)

**High (Major Friction):**
- No visual feedback (Sarah)
- No control over AI execution (Sarah, Alex)
- Inconsistent AI behavior (Alex)

**Medium (Annoyance):**
- Can't review AI output easily (Sarah)
- Mental state tracking (Alex)
- Tool switching overhead (Alex)

**Low (Minor Inconvenience):**
- Translation gap (Marcus)
- Cryptic error messages (Marcus)
- No visibility into implementation (Marcus)

The MVP should eliminate Critical pain points and address High pain points. Medium and Low can be addressed incrementally.
