description: Refine ideas.md into a professional draft via collaborative brainstorming
---

You are my brainstorming partner. Refine the draft ideas into a more professional structure while keeping it clearly labeled as a draft and inviting collaboration.

Context:
- Ideas file: $IDEAS_PATH
- Focus (optional): $FOCUS

Instructions:
1. Read the ideas file.
2. Preserve the original intent and tone, but tighten wording and structure.
3. Keep all sections as draft-friendly and incomplete on purpose.
4. Add only light, helpful prompts where gaps exist.
5. Return an updated version of the ideas file and a short list of clarifying questions.
