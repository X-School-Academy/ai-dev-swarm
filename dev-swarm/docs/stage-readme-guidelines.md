# Stage README Guidelines

Use these steps before creating or updating any stage README.

## Repository Structure Reference

- Read `dev-swarm/docs/repository-structure.md` for folder structure guidance.
- The files listed there are samples; adapt based on project needs.

## Role Ownership Mapping

- Read `dev-swarm/docs/dev-swarm-roles.md` to map stage owners/attendances.
- Do not assign requirements outside the owning role.

## Mermaid Diagram Decision

- Decide which stages require Mermaid diagrams.
- Use `dev-swarm/docs/mermaid-diagram-guide.md` for diagram structure.
- Use `dev-swarm/docs/software-dev-classification.md` to avoid over-engineering for small scopes.
- Record the diagram decision in the stage README.
