# Stage 00 - Init Ideas

## Stage Goal

This stage transforms raw ideas into structured business requirements that provide a foundation for all subsequent development stages. The primary objective is to clarify the problem being solved, define the proposed solution, and identify the target users and success metrics.

Clarifying the problem and solution upfront is critical because unclear requirements lead to wasted effort, incorrect implementations, and poor product-market fit. By capturing assumptions, risks, and open questions early, we reduce uncertainty and enable informed decision-making throughout the development lifecycle.

This stage will produce documentation that defines what problem we're solving, for whom, why it matters, and how we'll measure success. These deliverables serve as the single source of truth for all subsequent planning, design, and implementation work.

## File Selection

Given that the current `ideas.md` is a template without specific project content, this stage will focus on capturing the essential business requirements needed to move forward.

### Problem & Solution Definition

**`problem-statement.md`** - Clear articulation of the problem being solved
- Essential for aligning all stakeholders on what we're building and why
- Should include the specific pain points, target users affected, and current alternatives
- Provides context for all technical and product decisions

**`solution-overview.md`** - High-level description of the proposed solution
- Essential for defining the approach to solving the identified problem
- Should outline key features, differentiators, and value proposition
- Serves as a reference point for scope and MVP discussions

### Requirements & Users

**`target-users.md`** - Initial definition of target audience segments
- Essential for understanding who will use the product
- Should identify primary and secondary user groups with basic characteristics
- Provides foundation for more detailed personas in Stage 02 (if not skipped)

**`quick-questions.md`** - List of unknowns and clarification questions
- Essential for identifying gaps in understanding before proceeding
- Should capture questions about requirements, users, technical constraints, or business goals
- Enables early clarification and prevents assumptions from becoming technical debt

### Success & Risk

**`success-metrics.md`** - KPIs and criteria for measuring success
- Essential for defining what success looks like
- Should include measurable outcomes that validate the solution solves the problem
- Guides prioritization and helps evaluate trade-offs throughout development

**`assumptions-risks.md`** - Key assumptions and potential risks
- Essential for explicit documentation of what we're taking for granted
- Should identify technical, market, and resource risks that could derail the project
- Enables proactive mitigation planning and informed decision-making

## Note

The current `ideas.md` file contains only template placeholders. During execution, you'll need to provide the actual project concept, problem statement, and solution ideas so they can be expanded into these structured documents.
