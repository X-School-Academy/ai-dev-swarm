# Stage 00 - Init Ideas Proposal

## 2.1 Stage Goal

This stage aims to transform the raw concept of a "Free Subdomain Service" into a set of actionable business requirements. We will clarify the core problem—lack of simple subdomain registration—and define a solution that is both accessible and manageable.

By the end of this stage, we will have a clear understanding of our target audience, the technical constraints, and the metrics that will define our success. This clarity is essential for ensuring that the subsequent PRD and technical specs are grounded in a well-defined business need.

**Deliverables:**
- Problem Statement & Solution Overview
- Quick Questions (clarifications)
- Technical Requirements & Target Users
- Success Metrics & Assumptions/Risks
