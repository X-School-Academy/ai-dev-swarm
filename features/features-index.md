# Features Index - MCP Skills Server

## Overview

This document serves as the master index for all implemented features in the MCP Skills Server project. It acts as a knowledge base (RAG index) for developers and AI agents to quickly understand what features exist without reading the entire codebase.

**Status**: No features implemented yet (MVP in development)

---

## How to Use This Index

1. **Quick Reference**: Scan this index to see all available features
2. **Find Details**: Click feature links to see design, implementation, and documentation
3. **Understand Context**: Each feature links to related archived sprint/backlog
4. **Code Navigation**: Implementation references point to actual code locations

## Feature Template

When adding new features to this index after sprint completion, use this format:

### Feature Name

**Category**: Foundation | MCP Protocol | Skill Management | Security | Testing
**Status**: ✅ Complete | 🚧 In Progress | 📋 Planned
**Sprint**: Sprint X
**Backlog**: backlog-XX-feature-name

**Description**: Brief 1-2 sentence description of what this feature does.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Capability 1
- Capability 2
- Capability 3

**Implementation**: `mcp_skills_server/module/file.py`

**Related Features**: Links to related features

**Documentation**: Link to detailed feature documentation if available

---

## Archive References

Features are created from completed sprints. When a sprint is archived:
1. Extract all completed features
2. Add entry to this index
3. Link to archived sprint/backlog
4. Update statistics

**Archived Sprints**: None yet

## Notes for Developers

**Using This Index**:
- Read this index FIRST before starting any new backlog
- Reference relevant features instead of reading entire codebase
- Update this index when completing sprints
- Keep entries concise - link to details, don't duplicate

**Knowledge Base Principle**:
This index enables AI agents and developers to understand the system quickly without loading massive context. It's a form of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for the codebase.
