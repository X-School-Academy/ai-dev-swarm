# Responsive Design

## Target Ranges

- Minimum width: 1280px
- Maximum width: 2560px

## Layout Behavior

- At 1280px, collapse the right output panel into a toggle drawer.
- At 1440px and above, use three columns: navigation, content, output.
- At 1920px and above, increase content width and spacing for readability.

## Typography Scaling

- Base font size: 16px
- Increase to 17px at 1920px for improved legibility.
- Maintain consistent line height across breakpoints.

## Density Rules

- Keep primary actions visible without scrolling in the main content.
- Limit document list height with internal scroll at smaller widths.
- Avoid horizontal scroll in any primary panel.
