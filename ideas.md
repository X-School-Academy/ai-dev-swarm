# Project Proposal: Free Subdomain Service

## Goal
Create a simple web service where people can claim a free subdomain and manage it from one place.

## What Users Can Do
- Sign up and log in
- Pick a subdomain under available parent domains
- Manage basic domain settings for their subdomain

## What the Admin Team Can Do
- Offer multiple parent domains
- Keep registrations unique and organized
- Ensure each user only controls their own subdomains

## Phased Delivery
1. Basic signup, login, and dashboard
2. Subdomain registration and management tools
3. Polishing, improved validation, and readiness for launch

## Success Looks Like
- Smooth signup and login experience
- Users can claim a subdomain and manage it easily
- Reliable system that prevents conflicts and mistakes
